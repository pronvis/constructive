19.02.23 : renamed tuebeSoftHole (malnamed module) to tubeShell
18.02.23 : 
	###autocolor()
strongly simplified autocoloring system, just call assemble with two Arguments:
	like assemble("Part1,part2,part3","screws,part5,part6")autoColor((){ .....}
	the Parts in the firt Argument are considered to outer objects like Object shells 
	and are drawn in a transprent color. the "screws" and part 5 and part6  given in the Second argument 
	are considered drawings inside Detils and are drawn in Opque colors, so you can see them through the
	"shell" bodies. Every part is automatically given a distinct color from fixed builtin Palette
	
	 ###confinementOf()
	  a new simplified "confinement" mechanism to construct a confining Object for your Part
	  you may use it with intersection()
	  allows to use confinementOf() which assembles a confinement from Parts which are marked 
	  with the confines() marker function to mark which operations constitute a confinement detail,
	  like in add(confines("part1"))box():
		or in in remove(confines("part2"))tube(d=2,h=10);
		then you can use
		intersection()
		{
		confinement()moduleWithParts();
		assemble()moduleWithParts();
		}
		to confine the PArts inside the confinement
	 ###Gallery
	 		created a Gallery where new shiny constructive examples to see what can be acheived
	 		can be published in the Gallery,
	 		their code is not commented and not cleaned up, but still can be used for reference
